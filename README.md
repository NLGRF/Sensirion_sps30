# Sensirion_sps30
     The SPS30 Particulate Matter (PM) sensor is a technological breakthrough in optical PM sensors. 
     Its measurement principle is based on laser scattering and makes use of Sensirion’s innovative contaminationresistance technology. 
     This technology, together with high-quality and long-lasting components, enables accurate measurements from its first operation and 
     throughout its lifetime of more than eight years. In addition, Sensirion’s advanced algorithms provide superior accuracy for 
     different PM types and higher-resolution particle size binning, opening up new possibilities for the detection of different sorts of 
     environmental dust and otherparticles. With dimensions of only 41 x 41 x 12 mm3, it is also the perfect solution for applications 
     where size isof paramount importance, such as wall-mounted or compact air quality devices.
